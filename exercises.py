## Codes to Python questions

```
trna='AAGGGCTTAGCTTAATTAAAGTGGCTGATTTGCGTTCAGTTGATGCAGAGTGGGGTTTTGCAGTCCTTA'
```

```
A_count=trna.count('A')
C_count=trna.count('C')
G_count=trna.count('G')
T_count=trna.count('T')
print(A_count)
print(T_count)
print(G_count)
print(C_count)
GC_content = ((G_count+C_count)/len(trna))*100
print(GC_content)
len(trna)
AT_content = ((A_count+T_count)/len(trna))*100
print(AT_content)
```
The code above outputs the %GC ad %AT content.

Given the following amino acid sequence (MNKMDLVADVAEKTDLSKAKATEVIDAVFA), find the first, last and the 5th amino acids in the sequence.

```
aa_seq = 'MNKMDLVADVAEKTDLSKAKATEVIDAVFA'
print(aa_seq[0], aa_seq[-1], aa_seq[4])
```

The above amino acid is a bacterial restriction enzyme that recognizes "TCCGGA". Find the first restriction site in the following sequence: AAAAATCCCGAGGCGGCTATATAGGGCTCCGGAGGCGTAATATAAAA

```
restriction_enzyme = 'AAAAATCCCGAGGCGGCTATATAGGGCTCCGGAGGCGTAATATAAAA'
print(restriction_enzyme.find('TCCGGA'))
```
### **Program managing bank transactions**
```
accountbal = 50000

        if choice.lower() == 'b':

            print("Anything else?")
            choice = input("Enter b for balance, w to withdraw, d to deposit or q to quit: ")
            print(choice.lower())
        elif choice.lower() == 'w':
            withdraw = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
            if withdraw <= accountbal:
                print("Here is your: %.2f" % withdraw)
                accountbal = accountbal - withdraw
                print("Account balance is %d" % accountbal)
                print("Anything else?")
                choice = input("Enter b for balance, w to withdraw, d to deposit or q to quit: ")
            else:
                print("You have insufficient funds: %.2f" % accountbal)
        elif choice.lower() == 'd':
            deposit = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: "))
            print("You have succesfully deposited: %.2f" % deposit)
            accountbal = accountbal + deposit
            print("Account balance is %d" % accountbal)
            print("Anything else?")
            choice = input("Enter b for balance, w to withdraw, d to deposit or q to quit")

 ### Create a while loop that starts with x = 0 and increments x until x is equal to 5. Each iteration should print to the console.
 
    ```
    x = 0
while x <= 5:
    print(x)
    x = x+1
print("Bye")
```
### Create a for loop that prints values from 4 to 10 to the console.
```
i = 4
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
print("Bye")
```

```
for i in range(11):
    if i >= 4:
        print(i)
 ```
